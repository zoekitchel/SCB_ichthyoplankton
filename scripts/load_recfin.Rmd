## How we pulled data

-   Downloaded RecFin data on January 15, 2025 from [recfin
    website](https://reports.psmfc.org/recfin/f?p=601:1:13820808312939:INITIAL:::F_SELECTED_NODE:53&cs=3MMX4GLd8uuMBgMGOzscCAHvH_yUely3YcYGno0ODuz8s3Y2PDfjORospWxOA5ztpEkJ4jVH0U06YeC5-Kvv10g)

Filters applied for download:

-   Agency = California
-   Mode = All (Note, for some reason, there is NO Beach/Bank in
    2023-2024)
-   Water Area = Ocean (\<= 3 miles)
-   Subregion = South California
-   Trip Type = All

Thoughts

-   Not sure why no beach/bank in 2023-2024
    -   Beach bank catch estimates only based on online surveys, maybe
        these haven't been integrated yet?
    -   ALDOS (Angler License Directory Online Survey) is used to
        collect effort data only for beach and bank fishing, night-time
        fishing, and private access fishing that might otherwise go
        unaccounted for.
-   Should we include South district (San Diego, Orange, and LA
    Counties) and Channel district (Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties)?
    or just South?
    -   Ideally, just LA County?
-   Options for units are retained count, retained weight, released
    count, released weight, released dead count, released dead weight,
    total mortality count, total mortality weight
    -   Likely, we're most interested in Total Mortality count and weight (and therefore that's what I include below)

Helpful resources and tips

- [NOAA on CDFW-ALDOS](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/s3/2023-09/CDFW-ALDOS-PR1-PR2-Certification-OST-2023-Redacted.pdf)
-   RecFin data is a Catch Estimate
-   1979 - 2003 = Marine Recreational Statistical Survey (MRFSS)
-   2004 - Present = California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS)
-   1936 - Present = Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV)
    operators are required to submit logbooks to CDFW that include
    documentation of each fishing trip
    -   Each logbook entry reports effort (\# anglers and \# hours
        fished) and take (species and number fish caught)
    -   CRFS uses CPFV effort data collected by samplers in the field
        and logbook records to estimate CPFV effort

## Data processing steps
### I load the data from RecFin website, and merge all CSVs into one.

```{r,  echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# List all CSV files in the directory that match CTE001-California pattern
csv_files <- list.files(path = here::here("data", "RecFin"), pattern = "CTE001.*\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Read and merge all CSV files
recfin_data_merge <- rbindlist(lapply(csv_files, fread), fill = TRUE)

# Write to a new file with updated year
fwrite(recfin_data_merge, file = here::here("data","RecFin","recfin_data_merge.csv"))

```

### I make some small data adjustments to improve usability.

```{r,  echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Order factor for mode and add return to labels
recfin_data_merge[,mode_label := factor(RECFIN_MODE_NAME, levels = c( "Beach/Bank", "Man-Made/Jetty", "Party/Charter Boats", "Private/Rental Boats"), labels = c( "Beach/\nBank", "Man-Made/\nJetty", "Party/\nCharter Boats", "Private/\nRental Boats"))]
```

### Start by visualizing all RecFin data from 2004-2024


```{r,  echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.dim = c(7, 8), fig.cap = "RecFin total estimated fishing mortality by count. Note different y-axis scale for each district. Color specifies fishing mode, line type specifies fishing mode location."}

recfin_data_merge[,shore_boat := ifelse(RECFIN_MODE_NAME %in% c("Party/Charter Boats", "Private/Rental Boats"),"Boat-based","Shore-based")]

#Adjust factor order
recfin_data_merge[,shore_boat := factor(shore_boat, levels = c("Shore-based","Boat-based"))]

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.dim = c(7, 8),message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Total estimated mortality (weight) for most commonly harvested species (by either weight or count) using shore-based fishing methods in the South District. Data from RecFin. Note different y-axis scale across species. Color identifies species."}

SouthDistrict_ShoreMode_TimeSeries_LinePlot_Weight
```


I'm not immediately worried about changes in ID over time for any top species. It would be different if we were looking at rockfish, but no rockfish caught from shore.
